This application is a Ticket Booking website for upcoming events. It was built using React and includes the Front-End logic to display the upcoming events, show details of the events, as well as simulating a checkout. There are filtering features on the Home page that allow the user to search for and sort their events. The application uses Firebase for user Authentication as well as storing a user's booking history to be displayed on their profile page after logging in. There is a sign in page for the user to login in as well as a sign up page for new users to create a log in. I designed the application with TailwindCSS and a responsive design in order for it to be used on multiple different devices.
